data/
  all_tree_meta_data.csv - meta data (position in garden, block, genetic information)    for all trees (including failed Illumina samples)
  leafmeta.csv - sample data (sample #, Illumina info) + meta data for the subset of     trees that had leaf trait data collected 
  Merged_meta&sampledata.csv - sample data + meta data for all trees with successful     Illumina samples

pre-processing/
  compile.fungi.R - remove host contamination, cluster OTUs, assign taxonomy of ITS2     seqs (DECIPHER, ITSx)
  DataWrangling.R - clean samples and create Phyloseq object
  denoise.R - remove erroneous OTUs from ITS2 seqs (DADA2)
  trimSort.sh - shell script with programs Cutadapt and Seqpurge to remove primers and   adaptors from the sequences
  Merging_metadata_sampledata.R - merged tree meta data and Illumina sample data and     fixed labeling discrepancies
